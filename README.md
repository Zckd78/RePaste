<h1>RePaste - PasteBin Scraper </h1>

Just an idea that I had to create a small program that
taps into the recent pastes on Pastebin.com
As I started writing it and adding features, it's hit a stable point,
so I'm doing this push with more info for others.

<h3>Features:</h3>

<ul>
<li> Hits the recent posts on PasteBin.com </li>
<li> Displays a 1/5 length snippet of the paste </li>
<li> Saves Pastes according to matched type </li>
<li> Configurable Target number pastes, threshold for saving pastes, and more </li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
Python 3.5.1 or latest

<h3>Usage:</h3>
From a command prompt: >python Repaste.py

<h5>Currently this version doesn't yet support arguments,
but most of the framework for them is there. You can configure
them manually in Repaste.py </h5>
